            Confused and frightened, he rushes to untie his longtime friend, James. "I swear I won't tell anyone, please let me go?! I can't take it anymore, Help me." James cries out, trying to get up. Confused, Bryan responds by shouting "I'm here, it's okay, calm down" "Don't touch me, DON'T TOUCH ME!" "Stay calm, we came here to help you! But we got lost in the basement with the others. Normally they should come back here." "Please! Bryan! Bryan! Get a hold of yourself, nobody is here! It's just you and me. I don't know how long I've been here. you're not well Bryan you need help let me help you." Bryan is struck by an enlightenment and everything makes sense in his head, bits of memories come back to him tying up James, another one where he's running in the forest crying after abandoning him in this hopsi... He looks around and realizes that the laboratory was actually an abandoned hospital. Bryan, exhausted and with tears in his eyes, grabs a piece of broken glass and leans towards JAMES.
