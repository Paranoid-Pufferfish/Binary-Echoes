          The reality that Bryan is unaware of is that all his experiences are just a virtual world created by the chip implanted in his body, overwhelmed by his depression following the project's failure and the separation from his friends. These feelings take over, causing him to lose control over the chip. Thus, unconsciously, he lives in an alternate world at night, fueled by his fears and regrets, and wakes up unaware of his fate. Isolated in the middle of the forest, his friends, sensing the danger through their connecting chips, cannot reach him, at least not in reality. They appear every night in this multiverse by sending signals in the hope of waking him up to reality, but in vain! Can Bryan escape this vicious cycle? Will he accept the failure of his invention? Can his friends save him? ... Will you hear the Echoes again?
