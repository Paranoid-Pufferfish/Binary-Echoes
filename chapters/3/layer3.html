          Confused and frightened, <s>git</s>Bryan finds himself alone in this sinister basement of an abandoned laboratory. "Guys? Maya! Marcus!" he screams out, but only silence answers him, haunting the place. He begins to run, searching everywhere for his friends, who have all vanished now, until he finds himself in front of a large locked door with a schema . He explores several rooms where he will find documents that catch his attention, and with a sense of déjà vu, he remembers bits of documents and puzzles . <s>clone</s>A familiar voice echoes behind the door, urging him to enter running. Upon entering, Bryan examines the laboratory that seems familiar to him even though he knows for sure he has never been here. <s>COGNICTUS-BCI-Labs/</s>Among the dusty laptops and faltering machines, moans and cries turn into muffled screams. Confused and frightened, he rushes to untie his longtime friend, James. "Why did you do this to me?! How could you hurt me like this?" James cries out, trying to get up. Confused, Bryan responds by shouting: "What are you even<s>admin-console</s> talking about?" "You locked me in here, Bry!" "That's not true! We need to find Maya and Marcus, James, please, they were here with me, we need to find them." "Bryan! Stop! Nobody's here! They're in another country, they moved." Reality overwhelms Bryan; he is scared and lost...
