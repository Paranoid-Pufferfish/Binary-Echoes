      The soft click of keys echoed in the dimly lit room as Dr. Bryan navigated the laptop in front of him. Beside him,
      Dr. Marcus Miller watched with palpable tension in his eyes. Across the room, Dr. Maya Patel sifted through dusty
      files.<br /><br />
      "I think I found something," Bryan announced, breaking the palpable silence. Marcus and Maya turned their
      attention to him, a heavy anticipation lingering in the air of their clandestine hideout. "It's our former
      company's website, <b>COGNICTUS BCI LABS</b>," Bryan
          explained.<br /><br />
      <span><a href="https://web.archive.org/" target="_blank">"I found it in the online archives."</a></span> Their former workplace, where they had spent years developing technologies
      that now seemed so limited compared to their current ambitions. Without a word, Maya joined Bryan and Marcus in
      front of the screen. Lines of code scrolled by, revealing information bit by bit. "Look here," she murmured,
      pointing to what seemed like an ordinary paragraph on the page. They leaned in, their minds awakening to new
      possibilities.

      As the group pondered over the mysterious word <b>"DAY X300"</b> derived from the highlighted letters in the lab
      photograph description, they realized it must hold the key to their next clue. Maya, with a spark of recognition,
      remembered a journal bearing the same word engraved on its cover. With a sense of anticipation, they headed to the
      cabinet, its cold metallic surface to the touch. Bryan, the most agile of the group, skillfully unlocked it,
      revealing a treasure trove of vials and dusty documents. Among the forgotten relics of the past, they found a worn
      notebook with faded pages. Inside, scribbled in hurried handwriting, were references to the "new <b></b>TETA X300</b>
      microchip and geolocation data" within the company's systems. As they perused the notebook, gathering the cryptic
      notes, they realized that to access these hidden pathways, they had to decipher a series of codes scattered
      throughout the journal.
