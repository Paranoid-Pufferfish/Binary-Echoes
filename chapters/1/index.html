        In a dimly lit room, Dr. Bryan gently tapped the keys of his laptop. Beside him, Dr. Marcus Miller watched with a certain tension in his eyes, while Dr. Maya Patel rifled through dusty files on the other side of the room.
        <br />
        "Bingo! I might have something," declared Bryan, breaking the heavy silence. Marcus and Maya turned their attention to him, a sense of anticipation growing in the air.
        <br />
        "It's the website of our old company, COGNICTUS BCI LABS", <span><a href="https://web.archive.org/" target="_blank">"I found it in the online archives,"</a></span>

        Their former workplace, where they had spent years developing technologies that now seemed modest compared to their current ambitions. Without a word, Maya moved closer to Marcus in front of the screen. Lines of code scrolled by, gradually revealing information.

        As the group puzzled over the mysterious word "DAY X300" derived from the highlighted letters in the laboratory photograph description, they realized it must hold the key to their next clue. Maya, with a spark of recognition, remembered a journal bearing the same word etched onto its cover. With a sense of anticipation, they made their way to the cupboard, its metal surface cold to the touch. Bryan, the most agile of the group, skillfully opened the lock, revealing a treasure trove of vials and dusty documents. Among the forgotten relics of the past, they found a worn notebook with faded pages. Inside, scribbled in hurried handwriting, were references to the "new THETA X300 microchip and geolocation data" within the company's systems. As they pored over the notebook, gathering the cryptic notes, they realized that to access these hidden pathways, they would need to decipher a series of codes scattered throughout the journal.
