            As Bryan wanders around trying to search for the pieces to complete the puzzle, Maya and Marcus try to help by searching for him. They decide to split up to search for the documents and papers. Darkness suddenly envelops the area, and Bryan, along with his colleagues, tries to find the electrical breaker to re-illuminate the laboratory. The three researchers, using a flashlight, wander until... "I found it!" Marcus cries, opening the cupboard in the laboratory basement. Bryan rushes to him and tries to turn it on ... As the light flickers, Bryan turns around to check on the safety of his friends. However, a feeling of fear and unease washes over him as no one else is in the room with him; his friends have disappeared.
