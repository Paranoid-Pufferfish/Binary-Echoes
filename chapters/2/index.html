            Late into the night, Bryan searched alone for his missing friend.  Despite encountering inconsistent websites and sources, he persisted. Fatigue set in, but just as he was about to leave his lab, his friend  Marcus sent him a message saying ' I found something '. Bryan asked Marcus what he had found, but unfortunately, Marcus did not respond. Bryan tried to reach him by phone, but it was switched off. The next morning came, but there was still no word from Marcus. Bryan went back to work and took a closer look at Marcus's message.
